Player-
    Random Professor, 
        Let players input a name as an introduction to class, have students act confuse since it's not their professor's name (easter egg for real name with no reaction from students with multiple choice lecture material to really drive home this is our normal teacher)
    Health
        Go to a hospital upon physical "death" (Maybe implement money?)
    Sanity
        Go to an asylum upon mental insanity (Maybe money)
    (Maybe implement Soul/spirit, probably more of a hidden value to affect endings/personal reaction to how monsterous you become)
